# timestampMicroservice
freecodecamp project #1

This project was to create a microservice that would take in a date in the format (YYYY/MM/DD) or as an epoch and return an object showing the 
epoch and UTC date. 

Usage: - The program has a form that will accept input and return a json object
       - You may also route to /api/timestamp/:date and it will also return the same object
